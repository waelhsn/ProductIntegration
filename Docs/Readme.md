# Product System Integration

## Overview

This case study is about connecting two systems: one manages product names and IDs, the other manages product prices. It uses .Net to keep the data updated, stores it in Cosmos DB, and provides a quick API to access it. Extra features include handling new data fields and sending updates using Azure Service Bus.

### Architecture and Design

This solution integrates multiple Azure services (Azure Functions, Cosmos DB, and Service Bus) and external systems. It automates:

- Data fetching and merging from external systems.
- Database updates (product details and prices).
- Event notification for significant changes (e.g., weight updates).
- Scheduled maintenance tasks like weekly cache updates.

#### System A and System B work together to provide an API for product details (name, ID, and price):

- System A gives product names and IDs.
- System B gives product prices and notifies about price changes.

Azure Functions handle the data:

- **CosmosDB** is a data foundation and stores product details, prices and product statuses (if a product is New, Updated or Sent to the queue).
- **ProductNameUpdater** updates product names/IDs every 15 minutes from System A. As well as checking for new products and any logging changes.
- **ProductPriceUpdater** updates product prices whenever System B sends a price change via a webhook streamer.
- **ProductStatusUpdater** checks for any products with a status of "Updated" or "New" every 5 minutes. It sends these updates to a queue and then marks the products as "Sent" in Cosmos DB.
- **GetProducts API** allows users to fetch product details by ID or list of all products. It should be able to respond in less than 800ms in 10req/s load. Data is always fresh (updated within 15 minutes). The system is scalable and handles changes in real time.
- **Azure Service Bus queue** (ji-wael-poc) receives events like product updates for other systems to process.

## Code Walkthrough

### Helper Classes

#### CosmosDbHelper
- **Purpose**: Interacts with Azure Cosmos DB.
- **Key Function**: `GetContainer` - Returns a container for database operations.

#### HttpClientHelper
- **Purpose**: Handles HTTP requests to external systems.
- **Key Functions**: 
  - `GetDataFromSystemA` - Fetches product data.
  - `GetDataFromSystemB` - Fetches pricing data.

#### ServiceBusHelper
- **Purpose**: Sends messages to Azure Service Bus.
- **Key Function**: `SendEventToServiceBusAsync` - Sends product update events.

---

### ProductPriceUpdater
- **Purpose**: Represents a product's price update (used for event notifications as a webhook registration abon request). 
- **Properties**: `ProductId`, `ProductPrice`.

---

### ProductNameUpdater
- **Purpose**: Retrieves product data and ensures itâ€™s up-to-date in Cosmos DB. It either updates existing products or inserts new ones, logging each step.
- **Trigger**: Timer (every 15 minutes).

---

### ProductStatusUpdater
- **Purpose**: Checks for updated or new products every 5 minutes and sends updates to a queue. Marks products as "Sent" in Cosmos DB.
- **Trigger**: Timer (every 5 minutes).

---

### GetProducts
- **Purpose**: Retrieves product information from Cosmos DB, either all products or a specific product by ID.
- **Trigger**: HTTP GET request.
